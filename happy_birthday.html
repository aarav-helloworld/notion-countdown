                <p>Happiest birthday my GF, I have promised that I will always be there for you, you can always come to me... whenever you need me, you can talk to me and share it with me. I will always be your therapist. I was trying to think of what to get you for your birthday, I wanted to give you the best possible birthday gift. something special, precious, priceless, one of a kind... but then I realized that you already have me, so this birthday card will have to do!
